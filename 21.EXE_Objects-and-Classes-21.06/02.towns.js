function towns(input) {
    // Youâ€™re tasked to create and print objects from a text table. You will receive input as an array of strings, where each string represents a row of a table, with values on the row separated by pipes "|" and spaces.
    // The table will consist of exactly 3 columns "Town", "Latitude" and "Longitude". The latitude and longitude columns will always contain valid numbers. Check the examples to get a better understanding of your task. 
    // The output should be objects. Latitude and longitude must be parsed to numbers and formatted to the second decimal point!
